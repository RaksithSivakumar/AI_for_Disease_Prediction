# AI_for_Disease_Prediction
This project focuses on building a machine learning model for disease prediction (e.g., heart disease, diabetes) while ensuring transparency and interpretability using Explainable AI (XAI) techniques like SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations).
